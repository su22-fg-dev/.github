# Su-22 FlightGear Development

We are a community-driven development team focused on the high-fidelity reconstruction of the **Polish-operated Su-22M4 and Su-22UM3K** aircraft for the **FlightGear** open-source flight simulator.

Our goal is to create a **professional-level simulation**, with strong emphasis on:
- accurate flight dynamics (JSBSim),
- detailed aircraft systems,
- historically and technically consistent cockpit behavior,
- realistic operating procedures.

The project is developed using archival sources, technical documentation, and expert consultation where available.  
All work is conducted for **educational, historical, and non-commercial purposes**.

## Project status
This project is **under active development**, has been started in Janurary 2026.  
The aircraft is currently **not publicly released** while core systems and flight model are being developed.

## Philosophy
- realism over accessibility,
- systems before visuals,
- engineering accuracy over speculation.

## Collaboration
We welcome cooperation with:
- museums and archival institutions,
- former pilots and ground crew,
- FlightGear developers.

If you are interested in contributing knowledge, expertise, or technical support, feel free to contact us.
